"""Fact-check gate for a documentary (PLAYBOOK §12, §22.10).

The fact-check pass (a fresh session or subagent at max effort, see .claude/skills/fact-check) writes
<project>/claims.csv with one row per factual claim in the script:

  id,claim,on_screen,timecode,status,source_url,source_quote,note
  C01,"Prahlad Jani claimed no food or water since 1940",yes,00:18,claim,https://...,"...he said he had...",present as his claim

status: confirmed (2+ independent sources agree, or 1 primary source) | claim (reported as someone's claim, said so in
the VO) | disputed (sources disagree: VO says "as reported", other figure in description) | unverified | wrong.

This gate fails when any row is `unverified` or `wrong`, when a confirmed/claim/disputed row has no source URL and
quote, or when a disputed row has no note. Run it before every render:
