Film 2 of the roadmap (owner, 2026-11-09: roadmap order, data may move a topic up). Steps 2 and 3 done 2026-11-09: research, plan v2 after the independent review (`plan.md`, `review_plan_v1.md`). **The owner approved plan v2 with the title "ISRO's Hardest Weld Isn't for a Rocket" and the thumbnail "6 KM DOWN" (challengers ISRO'S WELD, WHY A BALL?) on 2026-11-09.**

## Done
- `brief.md` (machine, working paradox, viewer), `research/landscape.md` first pass (news to 6 Nov 2026, YouTube
  landscape and comments, draft edge), draft `claims.csv` (M01–M08 + two OUR CALCULATION rows).
- YouTube search sheets and `landscape.json` in `assets/ytsearch/` (gitignored).

## Step 4 and the opening (2026-11-09)
- Fact-check done for the plan's open items: `plan.md` §8a, claims M18–M27. The big change: ISRO's own video shows
  **five titanium pieces joined by seven welds**, not two halves. The 2021 test sphere was mild steel tested to 600 m.
  No public proof test of the titanium ball (the landing says so honestly).
- **The opening (0:00–0:45) is written and passes the promise check and `spoken_english_check.py`**:
  `narration.md`, `vo_opening.txt`, `words.txt`. Owner: English only, no Hindi, as simple as possible.
- ISRO's video (`assets/ref/isro_samudrayaan_230725.webm`, 3:30) is reusable with credit (ISRO copyright policy);
  upload it to Drive `English/matsya-6000/footage/` with the first footage batch.

## Narration (2026-11-09)
- Full narration v2 in `vo.txt` / `narration.md`, after the independent review (`review_narration_v1.md`). Both gates
  pass: `claims_check.py` (39 claims) and `spoken_english_check.py`. **Sent to the owner for approval.**
- Footage requests ready in `footage_requests.md` (Termux line, Cowork list incl. the blocked MoES PDFs).

## Next session, in order
1. When the owner approves the narration: ElevenLabs audio, one take per block (`scripts/eleven_tts.py`, Akash v4),
   every take through `vo_take_check.py`; listen for Matsya, Noh-teel, the names. The owner approves the audio.
2. Footage: send the owner the Termux line and the Cowork request from `footage_requests.md`.
3. Blender hero shots H1–H4 (plan §7 and §8a; H2 is five pieces and seven seams).
